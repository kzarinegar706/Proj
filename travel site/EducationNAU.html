              <p>Northen Arizona University is a public college and an excellent choice and has a beautiful campus. On average a student must have a 3.57 GPA in order to attend and should be involved in clubs or extracurricular activities. Around 50% of students that attend will likely graduate and they have a 78% acceptance rate. NAU is an incredible school but tuition is going to be around 20 to 30 thousand dollars <p>
