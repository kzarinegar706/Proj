                <li>My sister inspires me to go shooting because she knows of this perfect spot and tries to get me to go out on our freetime.</li>
                <li>Although I dont take this hobby too seriously, I would like to be able to learn more about the mechanics of guns</li>
                <li>Guns were first introduced in the late 15th century by the Ottoman Empire used strictly for war. One of the first guns ever invented was the musket which was that effective.</li>

            <p>My favorite type of gun to shoot is the FN P90 Machine Gun because of how fast and light it is.</p>
