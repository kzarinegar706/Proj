            <li>My biggest inspiration and motivation for skateboarding is Nyjah Huston because no matter how many times he gets hurt, he gets back up.</li>
            <li>My goals for this hobby is to stick with it even when it gets to hard and have fun with it. Afterall I am not planning on going pro</li>
            <li>Skateboarding dates back to the late 1940's which was originally called "sidewalk surfing". However, skating back then was much different from the crazy tricks that are mastered today. The board was shaped different and had biggger wheeles mainly for cruising.</li>
